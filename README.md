![Greenplum](mascot-opengpdb.png)

We've forked here the original GPDB repository after Greenplum became a closed-source project. And continue to make it production-ready.

The main goal is:
- to fix bugs, especially those leading to core dump master/segment processes;
- to adopt existing GP/PG extensions for the latest stable GP version;
- backporting stable features from other projects (Postgres > 9.4, Cloudberry);
- creating a new stable version (7.X) by fixing everything we stumble upon.

The current last stable version is 6X. It's used by major of our clients and partners. 

If you want to try it right away - https://yandex.cloud/en/services/managed-greenplum 

## Roadmap

You can check our [open-gpdb roadmap 2024/2025](https://github.com/orgs/open-gpdb/discussions/11) to see the
product plans and goals we want to achieve in 2024/2025. Welcome to share your thoughts and ideas.

## Build and try out

See detailed instruction about building, testing, build options, using Docker and Vagrant in [Build readme](README.build.md)

```
# Configure build environment to install at /usr/local/gpdb
./configure --with-perl --with-python --with-libxml --with-gssapi --prefix=/usr/local/gpdb --without-mdblocales
# Compile and install
make -j8
make -j8 install
# Bring in greenplum environment into your running shell
source /usr/local/gpdb/greenplum_path.sh
# Start demo cluster
make create-demo-cluster
# (gpdemo-env.sh contains __PGPORT__ and __MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY__ values)
source gpAux/gpdemo/gpdemo-env.sh
```

The default regression tests

```
make installcheck-world
```
